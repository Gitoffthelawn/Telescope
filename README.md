# Telescope

A new tab page focused on getting tasks done and getting to where you need to be quick.

## Rationale

I personally use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) as my day to day to-do list application. When I'm working at my computer all day, I happen to miss tasks I've set to get done until the day is over. As any developer would, I open a lot of tabs so I felt that this page could be better utilised with a better new tab page.

## Development

Telescope uses the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager, run `yarn` to get dependencies installed.

To start the development server, run `yarn start`
