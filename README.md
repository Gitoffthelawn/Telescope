# Telescope

A new tab focused on all the information you need right now.

Check it out at <https://telescope.jimmyd.dev>.

## Rationale & Goals

I personally use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) as my day to day to-do list application. When I'm working at my computer all day, I happen to miss tasks I've set to get done until the day is over. As any developer would, I open a lot of tabs so I felt that this page could be better utilised with a better new tab page.

The goal is to have different "telescopes" depending on what browser profile or computer I'm using. For example, my work profile has a specific background and Todoist filtering for work tasks only. For home use, I'd have one have a different background and Todoist filtering for general tasks.

Future expansion plans include integrating with other information sources and services, like the weather, news, and time tracking software like [Toggl Track](https://toggl.com/track/).
