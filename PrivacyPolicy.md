# Telescope Privacy Policy

> Last Updated: 3/12/2021

Telescope and its developer take privacy very seriously. In short, Telescope does not sell or rent your data and only sends data to providers you consent to.

External services that Telescope uses with your consent may collect your data. Telescope has no affiliation or control over these services, and we recommend for you to visit their privacy policies for information about how they may use your data. If you do not consent to using a specific service, you can disable that service in settings.

Telescope is an open-source application, meaning that the source code used for this application is publicly available. If you have the technical know-how, you can see exactly how your data is used by viewing the code repository at https://github.com/jamesdearlove/telescope

## Data Use Breakdown

For full transparency, we have listed below how each component uses your data.

### Command Bar

Telescope's command bar features autocomplete functionality that interfaces with other services in this list. Depending on your selected search engine, it may provide autocomplete functionality which sends your search query to that search engine. Privacy policies for each of the search engines available in Telescope can be found below:

- Google: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Bing: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement
- DuckDuckGo: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy
- Ecosia: https://info.ecosia.org/privacy

### Todoist

Telescope's Todoist functionality stores your API token you provide locally to provide access to your tasks stored in Todoist. Telescope connects to Todoist's API with your token and any additional settings that you have set in order to provide functionality.

Todoist's Privacy Policy can be found at: https://doist.com/privacy

### Weather

Telescope's weather functionality uses the Australian Bureau of Metrology's (BOM) data services. The location that you provide to Telescope is stored locally and is used whenever connecting to BOM's API.

### Other data

Telescope might locally store other data not explicitly mentioned here, notably application settings, to provide application functionality. These settings include things like background, theme mode, and bookmarks. If you select a URL as your background, that website might track your request to retrieve that background.
